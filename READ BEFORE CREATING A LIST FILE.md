A few things that should be noted before creating a .list file for this project.

-- Formatting is basically the exact same as a Travel Mapping .list file. For example, providing the state, then the route. The route naming convention is exactly the same as Travel Mapping, and route prefixes can be found within the PhotoData repository. For example, CA I-10, TX FM488, PA US422, etc. 
-- While photos are not required, we do highly recommend adding photo links next to the entries in the list file. These will show up in the route and region directory tables, but not on the completion pages. For example, AR AR5 (link). Any photo hosting service will work (Imgur, Flickr, self-host, etc.) but photos may be subject to link rot, so please keep that in mind.
-- If you create a .list file and edit it exclusively through GitHub, make a branch of your own of this repository and submit a pull request whenever it's ready. I'll try to update this as much as I can, although this project is still mostly in-development anyways.
